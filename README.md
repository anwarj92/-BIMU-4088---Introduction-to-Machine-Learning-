# -BIMU-4088---Introduction-to-Machine-Learning-
 Final Project 
Instructions to Run the Project

To run this project, the following steps should be followed:

Open the project notebook using Google Colab or a local Jupyter Notebook environment with Python installed.

Ensure that all required Python libraries are available. In Google Colab, the necessary libraries are pre-installed by default.

When prompted, upload the dataset file bank-additional.zip using the file upload interface.

Execute the notebook cells sequentially from top to bottom. The code will automatically extract the ZIP file, locate the CSV dataset, and load it into a pandas DataFrame.

Continue running the cells to perform exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature encoding, and scaling.

The dataset will then be split into training and testing sets, and multiple classification models will be trained.

Finally, the evaluation results, including model accuracy comparisons, will be displayed in tabular and graphical form.
